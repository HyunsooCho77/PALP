{"question": "can you have dual citizenship in us and haiti", "passage": "History of Haitian nationality and citizenship -- In recent years, there has been discussion about a constitutional amendment to change Haiti's stance against dual nationality; yet while feelings have begun to lean towards acceptance of dual citizenship, policy has yet to change. Legally, the 1987 constitution still stands, which states, ``Dual Haitian and foreign nationality is in no case permitted.'' The constitution also automatically negates Haitian citizenship with the acquisition of foreign citizenship, which strongly affects today's Haitian diaspora. However, there is an exception. A child with Haitian parents born outside of Haiti may dually acquire the citizenship of their birth country. At the age of eighteen, the child must renounce one of their nationalities.", "idx": 4338, "label": 0}
{"question": "is there less nicotine in ultra light cigarettes", "passage": "Lights (cigarette type) -- Cigarettes labeled as Lights, Milds, or Low-tar, are considered to have a lighter, less pronounced flavour than regular cigarettes. These cigarette brands may be listed as having lower levels of tar, nicotine, or other chemicals (as ``inhaled'' by a smoking machine). However, the scientific evidence is that switching from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce the health risks of smoking or lower the smoker's exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke.", "idx": 1707, "label": 0}

{"question": "is there such a thing as wild atlantic salmon", "passage": "Atlantic salmon -- In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by fly anglers during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery and a supplemental food fishery. However, the wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially dead; after extensive habitat damage and overfishing, wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are farmed, predominantly from aquaculture in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia. Sport fishing communities, mainly from Iceland and Scandinavia, have joined in the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy away commercial quotas in an effort to save the wild species of Salmo salar.", "idx": 8806, "label": 1}
