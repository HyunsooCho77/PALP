Club that he decided to write a children's story when he was trying to find a publisher for his first novel, The Basic Eight.

He retooled a manuscript he had for a mock-Gothic book for adults, which became ``the story of children growing through all these terrible things'', a concept which the publishers liked, to Handler's surprise.", "idx": 7465, "label": 0}

{"question": "did a filly ever win the triple crown", "passage": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States) -- Each Triple Crown race is open to both colts and fillies. Although fillies have won each of the individual Triple Crown races, none has won the Triple Crown itself. Despite attempts to develop a ``Filly Triple Crown'' or a ``Triple Tiara'' for fillies only, no set series of three races has consistently remained in the public eye, and at least four different configurations of races have been used. Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a ``triple crown''. In 1961, the New York Racing Association created a filly triple crown of in-state races only, but the races changed over the years.

However, the ``Pilot'' episode was filmed at CBS Radford. The laugh track was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claimed that shooting before a live audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so ``would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'''. Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion when smaller sets were used.", "idx": 1713, "label": 1}
{"question": "planetary orbits around stars in binary systems are always unstable", "passage": "Circumbinary planet -- Further work on the system showed that the orbits proposed for the candidate planets were catastrophically unstable on timescales far shorter than the age of the system. Indeed, the authors found that the system was so unstable that it simply cannot exist, with mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole range of plausible orbital solutions. Like other planetary systems proposed around similar evolved binary star systems, it seems likely that some mechanism other than claimed planets is responsible for the observed behaviour of the binary stars - and that the claimed planets simply do not exist.", "idx": 938, "label": 1}
