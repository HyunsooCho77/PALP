{"question": "is being dismissed the same as being fired", "passage": "Dismissal (employment) -- Dismissal (referred to informally as firing or sacking) is the termination of employment by an employer against the will of the employee.

Job seekers will often not mention jobs that they were fired from on their resumes; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment are often regarded as a red flag.", "idx": 664, "label": 1}
